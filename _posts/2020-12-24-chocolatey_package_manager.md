Choco는 윈도용 패키지 매니저. 리눅스의 apt, yum 같은 역할

1. 관리자 권한으로 파워셀 실행

2. 아래 명령어 실행
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`

Anyone can use Github as a free hosting server for their static website, called Github page, just with a little setup.
`repository > settings > GitHub Pages`

Once github setup is complete, you can find the public URL nearby.

<!-- ```python
def hello():
    print("world")
``` -->
